Up In The Air

HOW TO PLAY:
	A: Moves character left 
	D: Moves characer left

DELIVERABLES:
	Tracked Camera Narrative: At the start of the endless runner mini-game the camera starts from above the character and slowly comes down during a three second
animation. The camera then follows the player at an offset and will stay centered as the player moves side to side.
	Psychological Model for Main Character: The model for "Joel", Joeys alternative reality double, is completed with the exception of animations. Joey's model
is a work in progress, with his hair, head, neck, and upper torso modeled out.
	3 MiniGames: 
		Endless Runner: My endless runner is complete aside from cosmetics and failure code, it's a proceedually generated runner that gets harder the farther 
you go. Difficutly increases with speed and Joel runs along the road next to the bus Joey is riding along in. To save memory road blocks behing you are destroyed 
and new blocks are generated 6 blocks ahead of the player. A score is kept in a text UI at the top of the screen.
